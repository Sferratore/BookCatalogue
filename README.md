# BookCatalogue
BookCatalogue contains a Spring-Boot application which handles books, reservations and members. It simulates a library.

The project is a Java-based web application built using the Spring Boot framework. Its primary purpose is to provide an online catalog for managing information about books. 

The project consists of several key components, including a RESTful API for book management, a data model represented by the Book class, a service layer (BookService) for CRUD operations on books, and a controller (BookController) for handling HTTP requests related to books.

The application allows users to perform various operations on the catalog, such as adding new books, retrieving a list of all books, fetching specific books by their unique IDs, updating book details, and deleting books from the catalog. 

Each book is represented by attributes like ID, title, author, and publication year.

The project leverages Spring Boot's capabilities for easy development and deployment, making it a scalable and maintainable solution for managing book information. 

It follows best practices in software architecture by separating concerns into service and controller layers, ensuring clean and maintainable code. 

It's an ideal starting point for building a book catalog system with additional features and enhancements as needed.
